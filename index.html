            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a product and operations leader who builds high-trust teams
              and the operating systems that keep them moving. Over the past
              decade I've worked at the intersection of strategy, technology,
              and execution, helping teams turn ambitious ideas into durable
              products that serve real customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I lead Sunscription at US Solar, spanning customer
              acquisition, billing and payments, platform development, and
              long-term product strategy. My focus is on making community solar
              understandable, scalable, and genuinely customer-friendly, while
              coaching leaders to own outcomes end-to-end.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm especially interested in how data, automation, and thoughtful
              product design reduce friction without losing the human element.

            <h2>Current Focus</h2>
            <p>
              I'm exploring the intersection of AI, design, and business, with a
              focus on the systems and agents that will power the next decade of
              work. I'm drawn to tools that improve decisions, simplify complex
              workflows, and help teams move faster without sacrificing trust.

                <h3>Product &amp; Platform Leadership</h3>
                <p>
                  Building and scaling customer-facing platforms that handle
                  real-world complexity: utilities, billing, payments,
                  compliance, and support.

                <h3>Customer Experience at Scale</h3>
                <p>
                  Designing systems that balance automation with clarity and
                  trust, especially in industries where customers are rightfully
                  skeptical.

              <div>
                <h3>Growth with Constraints</h3>
                <p>
                  Growing responsibly in regulated environments, where success
                  depends on operational rigor as much as creativity.

                <p>
                  Building empowered teams with clear ownership, strong
                  communication, and AI-assisted workflows that remove busywork
                  and keep focus on hard problems.

                I lead the teams and technology that acquire, manage, and
                support residential community solar customers across multiple
                states. My role spans growth, customer experience, product
                management, and automation, with a focus on transparency and
                trust at scale.

                I've led marketing, product, and customer experience teams in
                healthcare, digital agencies, and early-stage businesses, often
                stepping in where strategy and execution needed to meet in the
                middle. I've also founded and advised small teams working on
                analytics platforms, growth strategy, and digital products.

            <h2>How I Think</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Complex systems fail at the edges. Design for the edge cases early.</li>
              <li>Clear language beats clever language, especially with customers.</li>
              <li>Scale exposes everything: bad assumptions, weak tooling, unclear ownership.</li>
              <li>Automation should create space for judgment, not replace it.</li>
              <li>Long-term trust is a competitive advantage.</li>
